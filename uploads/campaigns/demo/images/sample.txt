This is a placeholder for campaign media uploads.

In a real implementation, this directory would contain:
- Campaign ad images (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- Campaign videos (MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM)

The campaign details page will display these files in a beautiful gallery format with:
- Lightbox viewing
- Video playback
- Media descriptions
- Upload timestamps
- User attribution
